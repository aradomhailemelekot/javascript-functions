**Who**

This game is designed for individuals who are new to programming, and perhaps have difficulty grasping basic syntax of JavaScript grammar. 


**Why**

I created this game because my initial immersion in to programming, specifically use of JavaScript, was difficult! There was a limited amount of web content online to help me learn in this format, so I created a game that would have helped me learn at that time. (I hope it helps you to)


**What**

This simple game was created by use of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
