Your intorduction to JavaScript Functions

We created this game with the desire to help introduce the concept of functions to new students of JavaScript and programming. Through repatition or reading and typing javaScript functions, new users of the program can expand their level of comfort and usability with this language. Simply read the instructions listed in the game, internalize what they mean, and type them exaclty as they appear in the proceeding text area. 

This elemantry tool will help new programmers begin their path towards web development.
